## Requirements
1. App should contain one screen with a list of recipes 
2. Recipes should be retrieved via network from this [URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ababicheva/FlutterInternshipTestTask/main/recipes.json)
3. App bar must contain an app name and a search icon. Use [Icons class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Icons-class.html) to add the icon. There is no need to handle search icon click.
